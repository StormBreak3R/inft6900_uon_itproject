# UoN Mandarin Learning Web App

A full-stack web application that helps University of Newcastle students and staff learn introductory Mandarin Chinese vocabulary through an immersive multimedia approach.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project designs, develops, and deploys a web application that teaches 25 of the most commonly used Mandarin words.  
Each word is presented with:

- Chinese characters  
- **Pinyin** (Romanized spelling system)  
- A short video of a native speaker using the word in context  
- Audio pronunciation  

Unlike generic platforms like Duolingo or Memrise, our app uses **authentic, peer-created video content**, making the learning experience more relatable for the UoN community.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

Our goal is to follow a structured Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):  

1. **Planning & Requirements** â€“ Define functional and non-functional requirements.  
2. **Design** â€“ ERD, database schema, UI storyboard, system architecture.  
3. **Implementation** â€“ Full-stack development using Java (Spring Boot) + MySQL + HTML/CSS/JS.  
4. **Testing** â€“ Component testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).  
5. **Deployment** â€“ Local deployment via JAR file (future cloud deployment possible).  
6. **Maintenance** â€“ Clean code, documentation, and GitHub Wiki updates.
